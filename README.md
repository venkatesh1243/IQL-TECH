NeighborFit Project Assignment
 Project Brief
 Build a full-stack web application that solves the neighborhood-lifestyle 
matching problem through systematic research, data analysis, and algorithmic 
thinking.
 Core Requirements
 Problem Analysis & Research (50% of grade)
 ●
 ●
 ●
 ●
 Identify and define the core problem through user research
 Analyze existing solutions and their gaps
 Develop hypotheses about user behavior and test them
 Use data to validate or invalidate your assumptions
 Technical Problem-Solving (40% of grade)
 ●
 ●
 ●
 ●
 Design and implement a matching algorithm
 Handle real-world data collection and processing challenges
 Build scalable data structures and APIs
 Solve integration challenges with external data sources
 Systems Thinking (10% of grade)
 ●
 ●
 ●
 Document trade-offs and decision rationale
 Demonstrate understanding of scalability constraints
 Show systematic approach to complex problem decomposition
 Constraints & Problem Parameters
 Resource Constraints

 ●
 ●
 Zero budget - solve using only free resources
 2-week timeline - scope appropriately
 Limited data access - be creative with data acquisition
 Technical Constraints
 ●
 ●
 ●
 Must work with real neighborhood data
 Must be functional (not just mockups)
 Must handle edge cases and data inconsistencies
